# ArcOS
An operating system for an ATMEGA328P-PU (ARDUINO UNO), which can be usable for actual user computation at some level.

## Initial Bootup for Absolute Beginners.

The usage is very simple:

1. Upload the code to your Arduino Uno board.
2. Plug it in, and get your Serial Monitor open.
3. After it says (BOOTING OS), this may look like bad practice, put in the wire from pin 11, and RESET during its bootup process.

**ArcOS is now ready on your Arduino Uno for basic usage!**
